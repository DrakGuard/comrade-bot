Usage Philosophy
---

Meet Comrade, a discord bot who hands decision-making power back to the users themselves. Instead of a few moderators or an administrator choosing what your server needs, choices of this sort are now left up to the people. Do you want a custom emoji? Does someone need to be kicked or banned? Take a vote!

Comrade also has a couple of cute image commands, providing easy access to shibe or birb photos.

Invite Comrade!
